    /* Main interface of Computation.Core
     *
     * Events exposed by this interface can easily be used by the UI. They are only raised at the end of Update().
     *
     * The interface can be used pull- or push-based: Call .Value on interesting nodes yourself after Update() or
     * only call it on nodes you are subscribed to when they raise events.
     *
     * Values for user specified conditions/stats can be set using modifiers with TotalOverride form
     * and read/subscribed to in the usual manner (UI needs to make sure writing and reading doesn't loop).
     * IStat.DataType, .Minimum and .Maximum can be used to determine how to display the input field.
     *
     * Something that might be counter-intuitive:
     * Don't store any node or collection you don't subscribe to. ICalculator can't know that you are still using
     * nodes you are not subscribed to, resulting in them being pruned from the calculation graph and you now holding
     * a disposed instance. (can only happen to nodes whose stat graph has no modifiers)
     * (if this turns into a usability problem, creating extension methods on the problematic interfaces, that subscribe
     * to the instance with no-ops and return IDisposable to unsubscribe when done using them, shouldn't be much work)
     *
     * If the delayed events turn out to be a performance issue in the "preview calculations" use case, they could
     * easily be disabled: Either a property on ICalculator that turns off suspender usage in Calculator or a different
     * factory method than/parameter to Calculator.CreateCalculator() that passes an empty suspender to the constructor.
