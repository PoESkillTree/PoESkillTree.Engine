       TODO: Complete implementation of ICalculationGraph
       - INodeRepository implementation(s)
       - ICalculationGraph implementation(s) (see "Construction of the graph")
       - Usage from Console and/or integration tests (not using Data and Parsing, just example implementation of some builders)
       - Support for multiple paths and other "specialties"/behaviors in stat subgraphs (see "Stat subgraphs")
       (see the thoughts below and the thoughts scattered around in other files for details)
     */

    /*
     * Construction of the graph:
     * - Batch updates:
     *   1. MainNodeRepository.Suspender.SuspendEvents()
     *   2. Modifiers are added/removed to MainNodeRepository
     *     - All changed core nodes raise ValueChanged. This passes through the graph.
     *   3. MainNodeRepository.RemoveUnusedNodes()
     *   4. MainNodeRepository.Suspender.ResumeEvents()
     *     - All CachingNodes that received ValueChanged events raise their ValueChanged events
     * - Views:
     *   - MainNodeRepository.DefaultView is used for graph construction, the single-pass
     *     ICalculationGraph.NodeRepository and everywhere else where the SuspendableView is not used.
     *   - MainNodeRepository.SuspendableView is used for the two-pass ICalculationGraph.NodeRepository.
     *     It only raises events with the 4. step.
     *
     * Stat subgraphs:
     * - Can contain multiple "paths"
     *   - Per default, a path for each source (Global, and each Local source that has modifiers) is created.
     *     - Add a IModifierSource property to Modifier. After parsing, the actual IModifierSource is set, if parsing did
     *       not already determine a mod source condition (e.g. "from equipped shield" sets IModifierSource to Local->Item->OffHand)
     *     - Increase and More nodes on all paths link to the respective form collection of the Global path
     *     - Paths are children of the main UncappedSubtotal node
     *     - These paths use unconverted Base values
     *   - Conversions and Gains (from Bar to Foo) can add paths:
     *     - Adding a modifier with this stat adds a new path to Foo for each path of Bar
     *     - and adds a parent node for Foo to the Base nodes of Bar
     *     - the values between converting parent nodes need to be redistributed to achieve a sum of 100%
     *       (with modifiers with a skill gem source having precedence)
     *   - Implementation ideas:
     *     - IStat has a method an interface is passed to. That interface has one method for kind of path,
     *       which is called by the method it is passed to.
     *     - IStat has a subclass for each special stat and has a "void Visit(IStatVisitor)" method. Subclasses
     *       implement it by calling "IStatVisitor.Accept(this)". IStatVisitor has a method for each subclass.
     *       The subclasses need to have properties specifying where to add the path. E.g. the source and target IStat
     *       for conversions.
     *     - A more general solution, which does not fix all types of path in interfaces, would better. Similar to
     *       the idea for behaviors.
     * - Other "special" stats require a concept of "behaviors"
     *   - "Modifiers to Bar also apply to Foo":
     *     - Adding a modifier with this stat leads to the BaseAdd, Increase and More nodes (of all paths) of Foo
     *       also subscribing to the respective IFormNodeCollection (or aggregating node) of Bar
     *     - The stat's total value is used as multiplier
     *   - The IStat representing "Effectiveness of Added Damage". It modifies all BaseAdd nodes of all damage IStats
     *     so that they multiply the output by the value of the "Effectiveness of Added Damage" stat.
     *   - Each stat can have different rounding behavior. This can be a behavior of each IStat modifying itself.
     *   - Default values, e.g. for external stats, can be implemented with a behavior that modifies the BaseSet node.
     *     (NodeValueAggregators.CalculateBaseSet() should probably default to null then)
     *   - Implementation idea:
     *     - A method/property can be added to IStat that returns its behaviors (e.g. a collection of IBehavior)
     *     - IBehavior specifies the affected IStat and NodeType combinations and the effect it has
     *     - When removing a stat subgraph, behaviors caused by it must also be removed
     * - User entered conditions/stats must be able to register themselves, i.e. IExternalStatRegistry and IStat must be
     *   connected in some way. This doesn't seem to fit the behavior concept. Add an "IsExternal" property to IStat?
     *   - With such a property and a default value behavior, default values don't need to be stored explicitly.
     *   - With external stats, determining when a stat is no longer used gets more complicated. It can not be
     *     determined which references are only because the stat is external. To solve this, IExternalStatRegistry
     *     needs to supply a ValueChanged event for each external stat, which in turn subscribes to the node that would
     *     be accessible by the client side view (ICalculationGraph.NodeRepository). The graph internal and real client
     *     side references can then be determined by simply subtracting 1 from the count that would normally be used.
     *   - IExternalStatRegistry needs to be suspended/resumed in ICalculationGraph.Update()
     * -> Support needs to be implemented for:
     *    - A general concept of paths
     *    - Separating paths by Modifier.Source (which also does not yet exist) by default
     *    - Specifying further paths in IStat, mostly conversion/gains but maybe more (e.g. the different DoT from ailment types)
     *    - A general concept of behaviors, which can be specified in IStat
     *      - These modify the input/output values of stat subgraph nodes
     *    - External stats
     *
     * Data-driven Mechanics:
     * - New "CommonGivenStats" data class
     *   (can also contain things common between CharacterGivenStats and MonsterGivenStats)
     *
     * UI notes:
     * - The ValueChanged events can easily be used by the UI (transformed to PropertyChanged events in ViewModels)
     * - Values for user specified conditions/stats can be set using modifiers with TotalOverride form
     *   and read/subscribed to in the usual manner (UI needs to make sure writing and reading doesn't loop)
     * - A "DataType"/"ValueType" property would probably be useful in IStat. Without it, the UI can't decide how to
     *   display values or how to allow changing their value (in case of external stats).
     *   This would mostly be relevant for boolean stats. Maybe things like ranges could also be specified.
