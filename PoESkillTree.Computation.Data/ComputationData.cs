// As another form of showing that a mod is not supported, matcher implementations

// "{SkillMatchers}" mostly matches skills by name, which does not need to be implemented 
// in ComputationData
// TODO something needs to be done to match things like below (specify aliases for skills?)
//      and parts need to be defined somewhere

// Skills can be hierarchical, e.g.:
// Raised Zombie -> default attack (-> default part)
//               -> slam attack    (-> default part)
// Shrapnel Shot -> arrow part
//               -> cone part
// Frenzy       (-> default part)
// skill [-> sub skill -> sub skill -> ...] -> part
// Stats can apply to specific levels and may get inherited by lower levels, e.g. 
// "Raise Zombie deals 10% increased Damage" applies to both attacks,
// but "Raised Zombies' Slam Attack deals 10% increased Damage" only applies to the slam attack.
// SkillMatchers and ISkillBuilder can represent any level in a skill's hierarchy.
// Each specific level has names it can be referenced by, e.g. 
// "Raised Zombies' Slam Attack" and  "Shrapnel Shot's cone".
